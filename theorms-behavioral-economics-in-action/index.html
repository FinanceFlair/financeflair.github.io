At its core, the discipline seeks to explain why individuals behave differently than the models and theories of theoretical economics predict. This post dives into an often overlooked aspect of behavioral economics: &ldquo;nudging.&rdquo;</p><p>Before delving into nudging, let&rsquo;s establish a base understanding of behavioral economics. The field was born from interviews conducted by Richard Thaler and cognitive psychologist Kahneman in the early 1980s. And one of its earliest and most well-known concepts is the &ldquo;nudge theory.&rdquo;</p><p>A &ldquo;nudge&rdquo; is a subtle change in an environment designed to result in small changes in behavior without limiting an individual&rsquo;s freedom of choice. It operates under the assumption that many individuals are perfectly rational but often err due to their bounded rationality. Think of it as steering an individual toward something better without taking away their ability to make other decisions.</p><p>Nudging has been used in several domains, from saving for retirement to overall healthy living habits. Nudging is a strong technique in influencing people. Here&rsquo;s how:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The Endowment Effect</strong>: Suppose you give out pencils with your organization&rsquo;s advertisement on it at a conference. The attendees are more likely to remember your brand due to the endowment effect, making it more valuable to them than to individuals who did not receive a pencil.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Framing Effect</strong>: Suppose you&rsquo;re a doctor explaining and requiring a patient to choose between two surgeries. Patients are more likely to choose surgery A if you present its benefits as &ldquo;98% survival rate&rdquo; and surgery B as &ldquo;2% mortality rate.&rdquo; These are the same statistics presented in different frames, and people respond differently due to the framing effect.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Social Norm of Consistency</strong>: By leveraging individuals&rsquo; desire to remain consistent with their beliefs, values, and public statements, nudging can be powerful. For instance, when requesting people to donate to a charity, studies have shown a higher response rate when the pet after donating is to wear the corresponding logo openly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Default Effect</strong>: The default option&rsquo;s power is intense. In fact, inertia nudges people into taking it, whether it&rsquo;s mandating organ donation upon one&rsquo;s death or automatic enrollment in a retirement savings plan.</p></li></ol><p>And so, based on these four psychological phenomena, hundreds of real-world applications have been derived beneficial in various ways. From influencing one&rsquo;s daily behavior to affecting the broader social equities, nudging proves incredibly helpful.</p><p>In the public policy arena, nudging has been well-received. Theresa May, the former UK Prime Minister, formed the Behavioral Insights Team in her Cabinet Office, leveraging it to decrease tax evasion, improve organ donation rates, and increase pension savings rates. Similarly, cities like New York and Bogota have employed this to get people to plant trees, cycle more, and pay their taxes; leading to them being nicknamed &ldquo;Nudge Capitals.&rdquo;</p><p>Appreciate the power of nudging in more than marketing and sales. In education, it guides students to complete their homework, pays attention in class, and make better study options. Even in healthcare, nudging facilitates personal health record management and timely checkups.</p><p>Although nudging doesn&rsquo;t provide all solutions to the complex world&rsquo;s problems, we should be aware of this tool towards smart public policies, private initiative, and individual actions.</p><p>Theorem 2: Behavioral Economics in Action - The Lottery&mldr;</p><p>Behavioral economics once again challenges traditional economic thought. Popular notions suggest that individuals are rational actors, always making choices based on complete information and evaluations of expected utility. However, the &ldquo;Lottery Effect&rdquo; shows that not to be true.</p><p>The Lottery Effect is rooted in two behavioral phenomena: Loss Aversion and the Endowment Effect. It goes as follows:</p><p>Suppose we hold a simple lottery where the participants can either gain an amount equivalent to $200 or lose an amount equivalent to $180 with equal probability. It means they have a balanced expected value perfectly - an expected gain of $20 across lots of trials. But, even though this seems like a good deal, most people prefer not to partake in the lottery, fearing loss more than seeking gain â€“ negating the value.</p><p>In a second scenario, offer a sure payment of $150 to participant A - more substantial than the overall expected gain from the lottery. Toss in another participant B and give them the option to play the same lottery but receiving $80 if they win and losing $90 if they lose.</p><p>Looking at both choices, participant A takes the guaranteed $150, while participant B opts in the lottery. Thus, even though they faced the same expected value, their choices differed.</p><p>Such is the Lottery Effect. Human beings behave irrationally due to fear of loss, heeding to &ldquo;endowment effects&rdquo; and loss aversion rather than logical analysis. This behavior works against principles in classical economics, reviving the importance of behavioral economics and nudging.</p><p>The Lottery Effect plays its part in many scenarios, everything from financial investments, policy making, and even decisions on health-related actions.</p><p>So, what can be learned? Like a good coach, behavioral economics prompts that in some instances, eliciting an understanding of probabilities does not wholly guide us to rational decisions. Instead, deeply rooted impactful emotions like loss aversion affect us.</p><p>In public policy, this important behavioral economic concept supports the importance of helping people manage the fear of loss to make better sound decisions.</p><p>The end linkage between individuals&rsquo; choices, emotions, and their rationality is crucial to understanding the complexity of the real economic spectra.</p><p>To Summarize</p><p>The two theorems summarized herein encapsulate the layered insight of behavioral economics&rsquo; operation that classical economics overlooks. These two theorems reflect how behavioral economics aids understanding reality at its core.</p><p>Understanding and embracing concepts such as nudging and the lottery effect can lead to better policy making, encouraging positive behavior, and influencing individual and societal decisions. It paints our actions with broader hues, deeply rooted in psychology and sociology.</p><p>Our understanding of how and why individuals act as they do enhances gradually, enriches the economics stream, and helps build a more equitable and just society.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://finance.googlexy.com/categories/behavioral-economics-discoveries/>Behavioral Economics Discoveries</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://finance.googlexy.com/the-zeigarnik-effect-why-unfinished-tasks-haunt-our-minds/><span class=title>Â« Prev</span><br><span>The Zeigarnik Effect: Why Unfinished Tasks Haunt Our Minds</span>
