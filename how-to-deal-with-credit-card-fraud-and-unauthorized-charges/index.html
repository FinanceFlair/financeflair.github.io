Unauthorized charges can range from small, seemingly innocuous amounts to large fraudulent purchases. Here are ways to spot potential fraud:</p><ul><li><strong>Regularly review your statements:</strong> Check your credit card statements thoroughly each month. Look for unfamiliar merchants, unusual locations, or odd spending patterns.</li><li><strong>Set up alerts:</strong> Most banks let you set up SMS or email alerts for transactions above a certain amount. This real-time notification can catch fraudulent activity early.</li><li><strong>Monitor your transactions online:</strong> Use your bank’s mobile app or online platform to track purchases frequently rather than waiting for the monthly statement.</li><li><strong>Unusual transaction timing:</strong> Unauthorized charges often come in bursts or during unusual hours. Watch for multiple quick purchases or transactions that don’t match your regular usage.</li><li><strong>Check for small “test” charges:</strong> Fraudsters sometimes make a small test purchase to verify if the card is active before larger unauthorized charges.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=immediate-actions-when-you-detect-fraudulent-charges>Immediate Actions When You Detect Fraudulent Charges</h2><p>The moment you notice unauthorized charges, swift action is crucial to limit your liability and begin the recovery process.</p><h3 id=1-contact-your-credit-card-issuer-immediately>1.
