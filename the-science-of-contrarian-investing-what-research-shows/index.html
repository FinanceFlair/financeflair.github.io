This approach is based on the idea that at any given time, the market prices of assets are going to be influenced by emotions, sentiment, and biases, leading to overpricing or underpricing. By understanding the underlying psychology and behavior of investors, contrarian investors aim to identify mispricings and profit from them.
One of the key principles of contrarian investing is that it's not about being right or wrong, but about being early. Many investors are conditioned to follow the crowd and buy into popular trends, but contrarian investors are willing to take on the opposite view and buy into assets that are perceived as weak or unattractive. This requires a degree of independence and independence of thought, as well as a deep understanding of the asset's fundamental value.
Research has shown that contrarian investing can be a viable strategy for investors, but it's not without its risks. A study by Fama and French (1996) found that value stocks, which are those that are undervalued by the market, tend to outperform growth stocks in the long run. They also found that the best way to benefit from this effect was to invest in value stocks with the highest levels of book-to-market ratios, which indicates a high level of undervaluation.
However, another study by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (2013) found that the comfort effect can be a powerful influence on investor decision-making, causing investors to sell assets that are undervalued in favor of those that are popular or in vogue. This effect can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle of investor behavior, where investors sell their undervalued assets and buy into the most popular ones, driving their prices up even further.
In fact, research has shown that investor sentiment can be a major driver of stock prices, with investor mood swings having a major impact on investor behavior. A study by Kasznik and McNichols (2002) found that investor sentiment can influence the way investors think about an asset's value, with investors tending to overvalue assets that are perceived as popular or fashionable.
Another key concept in contrarian investing is the concept of the "reference class" problem. This is the idea that people tend to overestimate how unique their own experiences are and to assume that the events they have experienced are more typical than they actually are. This can lead investors to overvalue certain assets, such as those that are perceived as safe or high-quality, even if they are not necessarily cheap.
Investors who follow the market consensus and take a mean-reversion approach are often referred to as " follows the crowd". This strategy relies on the idea that market prices tend to revert to their means over time, so investors can benefit by buying into undervalued assets and selling into overvalued ones.
There are many ways to incorporate the principles of contrarian investing into an investor's portfolio. Some popular strategies include the use of sector rotation, where investors move into industries that are underperforming but have strong underlying value, and buying into assets that have low book-to-market ratios, which indicates a high level of undervaluation.
When choosing assets, many contrarian investors also look for those with high earnings yields, which indicate that the asset's earnings are high relative to its price. They will also search for assets that are off cycle, which often results in them finding opportunities that are both mispriced and strong opportunities. In addition, they will constantly update the evaluation criteria of the investments they are considering to prevent anybody taking advantage of the incoming information and changes to revalue them.
Overall, the science of contrarian investing is a discipline that involves a deep understanding of the psychology and behavior of investors, as well as the ability to significantly identify mispricings in the market. By going against the crowd and investing in underperforming assets, contrarian investors can profit from the tide of market momentum that makes these assets undervalued.
Recent research suggests that many investors are motivated to buy into the assets that share some personal traits such as factors that align social with cognitive beliefs. Some assets tend have unique information that disseminate conventional beliefs.
