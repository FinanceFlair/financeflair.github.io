Does this thought bring you unparalleled happiness and fulfillment? Probably not. This phenomenon is due to the concept of hedonic adaptation, coined by philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century. It suggests that our brains have an innate mechanism to return to a basal level of happiness or satisfaction despite significant life changes, including financial gains.
The Hedonic Treadmill Concept
The notion of the hedonic treadmill implies that our brains strive to return to a state of equilibrium where we experience a neutral level of pleasure or satisfaction, known as the "happiness set point." This mental equilibrium defends us against extreme variations in emotional experiences, ensuring long-term well-being. However, it often leads us to pursue more and more, thinking that the next milestone or financial achievement will finally guarantee lasting happiness.
Psychology of the Hedonic Adaptation
Psychologists Richard Easterlin and Angus Deaton conducted extensive research on the concept of hedonic adaptation, producing groundbreaking insights into human psyche. They demonstrated that significant financial gains lead to temporary increases in happiness but eventually stagnate on the baseline set point due to hedonic adaptation. Moreover, significant financial losses render individuals less happy. According to Easterlin's paradox, however, within a society where average incomes increase significantly over time, rising overall incomes do not correlate with enduring happiness.
Adaptation and Expectations
When individuals anticipate acquiring a desired financial goal, their brain naturally prepares itself for increased happiness upon obtaining it. This shrinks the magnitude of uplift expected once the goal is reached, rendering adaptation inevitable. Expectations create a sort of ceiling, defying the potential happiness that should realistically result from achieving a desired goal. Research studies support this idea: in longevity experiments involving significant financial gains, initial spikes in well-being were observed, but with time, baseline happiness returned to initial levels.
Cognitive Dissonance and Growth Mindset
To prevent continued dissatisfaction and avid pursuit in going after overly ambitions financial goals, awareness about our brain's limitations becomes essential. Cognitive dissonance, a psychological phenomenon where we revise our behaviors to mitigate discomfort from opposing goals and beliefs, educates individuals about maintaining moderate and genuine aspirations. Growth mindset deficiency fuels the relentless expectations, provoking people to constantly strive for an even greater improvement, particularly concerning financial milestones, causing discontent with what has been accomplished.
Why Does the Brain Favor Hedonic Adaptation?
