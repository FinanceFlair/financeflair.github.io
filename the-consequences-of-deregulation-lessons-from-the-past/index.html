Some argue that regulations stifle innovation and hinder economic growth, while others contend that they are necessary to protect consumers and maintain a level playing field. But what happens when regulations are repealed or reduced? What are the consequences of deregulation? This post explores the lessons from the past to examine the outcomes of this complex issue.
The Energy Sector: Deregulation's Mixed Record
One of the most striking examples of deregulation is the energy sector. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the energy industry was subject to strict regulations, which led to a lack of competition and innovation. In response, legislation such as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act of 1935 aimed to increase competition and promote the development of alternative energy sources.
However, it was not until the 1980s and 1990s, with the energy policy of the Reagan administration, that significant deregulation occurred. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 enabled the energy industry to operate with fewer federal controls.
The results have been mixed. On the one hand, deregulation led to increased competition, which drove down prices and forced utilities to improve services. On the other hand, it also exposed consumers to market fluctuations and made them more vulnerable to price shocks. In some regions, prices skyrocketed, leaving low-income households struggling to afford basic services.
The Housing Market: A Cautionary Tale
The housing market is another sector where deregulation has had a profound impact. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 repealed parts of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibited commercial banks from engaging in investment activities. This led to the creation of financial institutions that combined banking, insurance, and securities under a single roof.
The consequences were catastrophic. The lax oversight and excessive risk-taking led to the mortgage crisis of 2008, which resulted in the collapse of the global financial system. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act was seen as a major factor in the crisis, and its reinstatement has been proposed by various experts.
The Financial System: Lessons from History
In 1929, the stock market crash of 1929 was a direct result of the unchecked speculative bubble created by unregulated investment banking. The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 introduced significant regulations to prevent such an event from recurring.
However, the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act led to a relaxation of oversight, which contributed to the asset bubbles of the late 1990s and early 2000s. While it is difficult to pinpoint deregulation as the sole cause, the deregulation of the financial sector created a precarious environment that facilitated the housing market bubble and the subsequent financial crisis.
The Agriculture Sector: The Failure of Empirical Policy
The deregulation of the agriculture sector is another example of regulatory failure. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the Agricultural Act of 1954 were implemented to protect farmers and stabilize markets. However, the regulatory regime was gradually dismantled in the 1990s and early 2000s, as politicians argued that policies were unnecessary.
The removal of regulations led to increased market competition, which resulted in devastating price volatility for farmers. Between 2006 and 2008, the average wheat price dropped by 36%, and the trend has continued in the years since. This affects not only farmers but also consumers, who face price spikes when demand increases and supply dwindles.
The Waterways: Deregulation's Devastating Consequences
The deregulation of the waterways is another area where the lack of oversight has led to devastating consequences. The 1980 licensing of ships to carry non-liquid goods such as oil, a deregulation known as the Shipping Act of 1984, led to an unnecessary level of risk due to inadequate oversight.
When a massive oil tanker crashed in New York's Hudson River in 2007, the cleanup efforts revealed how the relaxed regulations had exposed the nation to unnecessary danger. Owners literally thought one more risk was too many instead of none.
What Can We Learn from the Past?
The examples discussed highlight the perils of deregulation. They demonstrate that removing or weakening regulations can have unpredictable and detrimental consequences. The concept of the other road sees unregulated markets slumping while predictability of major errors when setting policies went unexplored.

Conclusion
As we explore the consequences of deregulation, several lessons emerge. First, a well-designed regulatory framework is crucial for maintaining public trust, protecting consumers, and preventing disasters such as the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, a balanced approach to policy-making recognizes the need for regulation while fostering innovation and economic growth.
Second, the history of deregulation serves as a stark reminder that policies without solid empirical evidence can lead to unintended consequences. It highlights the critical importance of understanding the nuances and complexities of an industry before dismantling regulations. By extrapolating from the past, policymakers can identify and mitigate potential pitfalls, ensuring that future policies safeguard rather than serve public interests.
