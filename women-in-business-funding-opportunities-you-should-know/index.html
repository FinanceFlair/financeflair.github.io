Traditional sources of financing often overlook or undervalue the unique contributions women bring to the table, leaving many without the necessary resources to turn their dreams into reality. However, there are numerous initiatives and organizations committed to addressing this disparity and providing women with the funding they need to succeed.
Government Programs for Women-Owned Businesses
The government has implemented various programs designed to support women entrepreneurs through funding and business development. The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers two loan programs specifically tailored for women-owned small businesses (WOSBs): the 7(a) Loan Program and the Microloan Program. While not exclusively focused on women, these programs recognize the barriers women face in accessing capital and provide a dedicated effort to rectify this imbalance.
The Women's Venture Capital Fund, a $50 million Public-Private Partnership between the SBA and the private sector, aims to empower female-led ventures by investing in early-stage companies. This fund has nurtured numerous successful businesses and created a network of female entrepreneurs and executives.
Funding Platforms Supporting Women in Business
Several online funding platforms have emerged to serve as a gateway for women-owned businesses seeking capital.
Lithic, a fintech company, has launched a digital funding platform granting access to over $100 million in loans. Partnering with commercial banks, Lithic enables women entrepreneurs to access credit at more favorable terms than traditional lending institutions.
RippleMatch, another pioneering platform, connects female founders with investors, corporate partners, and mentors. This collaborative environment allows women to refine their business models, build their professional networks, and scale their companies.
eCornell, a part of Cornell University, offers certification in Entrepreneurship, empowering women to develop essential business skills and establish themselves as credible entrepreneurs.
Foundations and Organizations Promoting Women's Entrepreneurship
Numerous private foundations, corporate organizations, and advocacy groups prioritize supporting women through various means: grants, investment, and mentorship.</p><p>NowWomen, a giving circle, combines collective philanthropy with impact investing to empower women-run businesses and organizations worldwide. This unique approach fosters global partnerships and promotes long-term economic change.
Mintel's Investing in Women program continuously partners with influential brands and organizations to strengthen women-led businesses. Through grants and advocacy, they empower women to become effective leaders across industries.
As part of its Women's Business Equity Fund, KeyBank provides credit facilities and other business development tools to enhance women-led companies' commercial viability.
To further bridge this gap, traditional banking and finance institutions have upped their game in acknowledging and supporting women in business.
Progress Among Financial Institutions
Investing in Women, an initiative powered by CH4 Foundation, and advocacy think tank The Women in Finance Foundation (TNWiF) address the skills gap women face in accessing capital markets.
First Boulevard, a New York-based fintech, stepped up by offering accessible credit options to women entrepreneurs.
