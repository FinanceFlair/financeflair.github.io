With the need to constantly travel and stay in new places, you may need to budget for things like flights, accommodations, and transportation. This can make it difficult to save for retirement, as you may not have as much disposable income.</p><h2 id=creating-a-retirement-plan-as-a-digital-nomad>Creating a Retirement Plan as a Digital Nomad</h2><p>So, how do you create a retirement plan as a digital nomad?
