A positive cash flow ensures that a business has the necessary liquidity to cover its short-term obligations, invest in new opportunities, and ultimately, drive long-term value. However, with numerous cash flow metrics available, business decision-makers may find it challenging to prioritize and focus on the key metrics that accurately gauge the financial performance of their business. In this comprehensive guide, we will discuss the top cash flow metrics you should be tracking to ensure your business remains successful.</p><ol><li>Accounts Receivable Days
Accounts Receivable Days is a liquidity-based metric that measures how quickly customers pay their outstanding balances. To calculate accounts receivable days, add the total number of outstanding accounts, multiply it by the number of days, and divide by the average daily sales.
Accounts Receivable Days = (Total Outstanding Accounts x Number of Days) / Average Daily Sales
By tracking accounts receivable days, businesses can identify potential problems related to slow-paying customers and ensure that adequate measures are in place to collect outstanding debts. A lower accounts receivable days figure indicates that customers are more likely to pay their outstanding balances in a timely manner, injecting cash into the company's coffers.</li><li>Accounts Payable Days
Accounts Payable Days is a cash flow metric that measures how long it takes to pay suppliers and vendors. To calculate accounts payable days, you'll need to determine the average payments made to suppliers, divide it by the total purchases, and then multiply by the number of days.
Accounts Payable Days = (Average Payments to Suppliers / Total Purchases) x Number of Days
By tracking accounts payable days, businesses can identify opportunities to negotiate better payment terms with suppliers, reduce bills, and inject liquidity into the organization.</li><li>Cash Conversion Cycle
The Cash Conversion Cycle is a crucial metric that measures the time it takes for a company to sell its inventory, collect accounts receivable, and pay accounts payable. A shorter cycle indicates efficient working capital utilization.
Cash Conversion Cycle = Days Inventory Outstanding + Receivable Days - Payable Days
The cash conversion cycle is vital for businesses operating in competitive industries where inventory turnovers are significant. By improving the cash conversion cycle, companies can optimize their working capital, enhance operational efficiency, and excel in the market.</li><li>Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
Days Sales Outstanding is a metric that calculates the time it takes for customers to pay their bills. By performing this calculation, businesses can gauge their sales performance, identify potential payment issues, and devise targeted strategies to reduce customer payment terms.
DSO = Total Outstanding Sales / Total Daily Sales x Number of Days
A longer DSO period can signal to investors and lenders that a business may face future financial difficulties due to difficulties in meeting monetary obligations on time. On the other hand, a faster collection of payments enables companies to build a solid financial foundation.</li><li>Cash to Cash Cycle
The Cash to Cash Cycle, also referred to as the Cash Cycle or Cash Cycle Length, represents the period it takes for a company to generate cash from its sales. To calculate the cash cycle, estimate accounts receivable days, cash cycle, and accounts payable days using the following formula:
Cash to Cash Cycle = Cash Billable / Days Sales Outstanding + 0.25 * Days Inventory Outstanding + 0.25 * Days Payable Outstanding
This metric helps businesses refine cash flow projection, enforce timely account payment, and understand whether daily cash inflows are matching daily cash outflows.</li><li>Gross Margin
The overall profitability of a business is crucial for measuring cash flow sustainability. Gross Margin is the numerical representation of total revenue minus both the cost of goods sold and direct material and labor expenses. A higher gross margin ensures a healthy profit from each disposable product or service, ensuring that revenue provides the resources to cover operational costs.
Gross Margin = Total Revenue - (Cost of Sales + Direct Labor Costs + Direct Material Costs)/ Total Revenue
Establishing high product prices and, consequently, ideal income provides the foundation that can expand on business operations, diversified growth strategies, and streamlined surplus technical staff.</li><li>Daily Sales Growth
