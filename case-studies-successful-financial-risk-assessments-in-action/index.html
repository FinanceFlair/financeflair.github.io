Case Study 3: A Public Sector Entity's Risk Assessment Drives Cost Savings
A public sector entity, responsible for managing a large public transportation system, identified that its risk management processes were fragmented and inefficient. The entity realized that its lack of a centralized risk management framework made it vulnerable to losses and reputational damage.
