These platforms simplify investing by allowing users to contribute small sums of money, making it accessible to almost anyone. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, many micro investing apps have expanded their offerings to include digital assets alongside traditional stocks and ETFs. This fusion opens up new opportunities for those looking to diversify their portfolios without needing a significant upfront investment. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore the ecosystem of micro investing apps that include cryptocurrency options, their benefits, the features to look for, and how to make the most of these tools for your financial future.</p><h2 id=what-is-micro-investing>What Is Micro Investing?</h2><p>Micro investing refers to the process of investing small amounts of money regularly rather than large lump sums.
