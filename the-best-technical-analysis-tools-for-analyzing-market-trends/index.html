While many factors contribute to market behavior, technical analysis remains one of the most powerful methods for analyzing price movements and predicting future market trends. By examining historical data and chart patterns, traders can gain insights into market psychology, momentum, and potential turning points.</p><p>To effectively navigate these trends, it’s crucial to use the best technical analysis tools available.
