However, many cardholders are unaware of the hidden fees that can quickly add up and make their credit card less than ideal. In this article, we will delve into the world of credit card fees, highlighting the most common types and providing tips on how to avoid them.
Types of Credit Card Hidden Fees
Before we dive into the specifics of credit card fees, it's essential to understand the various types that can apply to your account. Here are some of the most common hidden fees associated with credit cards:
Foreign Transaction Fees
When using your credit card abroad, you may incur an additional fee for every transaction. This fee typically ranges from 1-3% of the purchase price and can add up quickly, especially on large transactions.
Late Payment Fees
Missing a payment deadline can result in a late payment fee, which varies among credit card issuers. This fee is usually a one-time charge and can range from $25 to $38.
Balance Transfer Fees
Balance transfer fees are charged when you transfer an outstanding balance from one credit card to another. This fee typically ranges from 3-5% of the transferred amount.
Cash Advance Fees
When using your credit card to withdraw cash from an ATM, you'll often incur a cash advance fee, which can range from 2-5% of the withdrawal amount.
Interest Rate Hikes
Some credit cards come with variable interest rates that can change over time. This change can result in a higher interest rate and a significant increase in your monthly payments.
Annual Fees
Annual fees are a one-time charge levied on your credit card account each year. These fees can be as low as $25 or as high as $500, depending on the card's features and benefits.
Foreign Exchange Fees
When making purchases abroad, your credit card issuer may charge a foreign exchange fee, which can range from 1-3% of the transaction amount.
