Focus on Quality</h3><p>When choosing dividend stocks, prioritize companies with strong fundamentals, solid balance sheets, and a history of consistent dividend payments. Look for firms with low debt levels and stable cash flows, as these attributes will help them weather economic downturns.</p><h3 id=2-diversify-your-portfolio>2.
