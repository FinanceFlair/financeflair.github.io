It enables entrepreneurs, artists, and innovators to pitch their ideas to a large audience and invite them to contribute financially to bring those ideas to fruition. Traditionally, crowdfunding involved offline methods such as soliciting funds through events or personal networks. However, the advent of digital platforms has revolutionized the process, making it more accessible and scalable.</p><h2 id=types-of-crowdfunding-platforms>Types of Crowdfunding Platforms</h2><h3 id=reward-based-crowdfunding>Reward-Based Crowdfunding</h3><p>Reward-based crowdfunding platforms allow creators to offer incentives or rewards to individuals who contribute to their campaigns.
