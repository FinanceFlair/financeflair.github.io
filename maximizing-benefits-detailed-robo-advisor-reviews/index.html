Founded by Sallie Krawcheck, Ellevest stands out in a market dominated by male leadership by prioritizing the investment needs of women. Smart algorithms couple with gender-specific investment strategies tailored to each client&rsquo;s economic situation, goals, and tolerance for risk.</li></ol><p><strong>Account Types & Investment Minimums</strong>: Ellevest is reachable for all investors, with six account types available ranging from taxable brokerage accounts to traditional, SEP, and Roth IRAs.

These fees can be waived by enrolling in their Acorns Earn program that rewards members for shopping at participating retailers. Customized options for investment portfolios, the Acorns investment suite, and Acorns Plus command slightly higher fees, both ranging at $2-$3/month.</p><p><strong>Investment Offerings & Asset Allocation</strong>: Acorns utilizes an actively managed investment strategy, offering five portfolio options based on risk tolerance, ranging from 3 - 100% stocks.
