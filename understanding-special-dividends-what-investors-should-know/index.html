While they can be an exciting surprise for investors, special dividends can also be complex and nuanced. In this article, we'll explore the ins and outs of special dividends, how they are declared, and what investors should know before investing in companies that make these payouts.
What is a Special Dividend?
A special dividend is a one-time payment made by a company to its shareholders from its earnings, often in a year when the company has generated an unusually high profit. Unlike regular quarterly dividends, special dividends are not a standard part of a company's dividend structure and are usually paid at the discretion of the company's board of directors.
Who is Eligible to Receive Special Dividends?
All shareholders of a company who own shares on a specific date, known as the record date, are entitled to receive special dividends. However, the share price may be affected by the declaration of a special dividend, and shareholders who buy or sell shares close to the record date may not receive the dividend payout.
How are Special Dividends Declared?
Special dividends are typically declared by a company's board of directors when the company has accumulated excess cash or other assets. The board may choose to pay out this excess cash as a special dividend, rather than reinvesting it in the business. The company's management team and finance department will work together to determine the amount of the special dividend, taking into account factors such as the company's profitability, cash reserves, and long-term financial goals.
Types of Special Dividends
There are two main types of special dividends:</p><p>Capital Return Dividends: These dividends are paid by companies that have excess cash reserves and want to return it to shareholders. Capital return dividends are typically a one-time payment and are often seen as a signal that a company has excess cash and is looking to return it to investors.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) Payment: DRIPs allow shareholders to reinvest their dividend payments into additional shares of the company. If a company has a DRIP in place, it may declare a special dividend that is used to fund the reinvestment of dividend payments, rather than issuing new shares.</p><p>Tax Implications of Special Dividends
Special dividends are taxable as ordinary income, and shareholders will be required to report them on their tax returns. The tax implications of special dividends can vary depending on the individual's tax situation, so it's essential for investors to consult with a tax professional to understand their specific obligations.
Benefits and Drawbacks of Special Dividends
Special dividends can be beneficial for investors in several ways:</p><p>Unlocked Value: Special dividends can provide a one-time payment to shareholders, unlocking value that may have been tied up in the company's cash reserves.
Return on Investment: Special dividends can be a way for companies to return value to investors who have invested in the business over the long-term.</p><p>However, special dividends can also have drawbacks:</p><p>Share Price Volatility: The announcement of a special dividend can lead to a temporary increase in share price followed by a decline. Investors who buy or sell shares close to the record date may be affected by this volatility.
Less Predictable: Unlike regular quarterly dividends, special dividends are less predictable and may not be a standard part of a company's dividend structure.</p><p>How to Invest in Companies that Make Special Dividends
Investors who are interested in companies that make special dividends can search for companies with a history of declaring these payments. Some of the key metrics to look for include:</p><p>Dividend Yield: Companies with high dividend yields may be more likely to declare special dividends.
Cash Reserves: Companies with significant cash reserves are more likely to declare special dividends.
Financial Performance: Companies with a strong financial performance are more likely to declare special dividends.</p><p>Investors can also consider investing in companies that have a history of returning value to shareholders through special dividends. Some examples of companies that have made significant special dividend payments in the past include AT&amp;T, Caterpillar, and Boeing.
Conclusion
Special dividends can be a valuable tool for companies to return excess cash to shareholders. Investors should be aware of the different types of special dividends, how they are declared, and the tax implications of receiving these payments. By understanding the benefits and drawbacks of special dividends, investors can make more informed decisions and maximize their return on investment.
As always, we encourage investors to do their own research and consult with a financial advisor before investing in a company. Remember, the decision to invest in a company is a personal decision and should be based on your individual financial goals and risk tolerance.
