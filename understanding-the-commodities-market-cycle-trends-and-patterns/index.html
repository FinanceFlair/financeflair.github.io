One of the most crucial concepts to grasp when navigating the commodities market is the cycle of trends and patterns that govern its behavior. This cycle is influenced by a range of economic, environmental, and social factors, as well as government policies and market sentiment.
A Complete Cycle
A full cycle typically consists of four stages: accumulation, active phase, mature phase, and bear market. Each stage is characterized by distinct patterns and trends that unfold over time. Understanding these stages and the transitioning between them is essential for informed decision-making in the commodities market.
Accumulation Stage
The accumulation stage is the beginning of a new cycle, where prices are at their lowest and investors are pessimistic about the market. This stage is characterized by a decrease in the price of commodities, leading to lower production costs and an increase in supply. Financial investors, looking for value, step into the market and begin to buy these low-priced commodities. Market participants begin to accumulate positions, which eventually drives prices up. The accumulation stage can last from several months to a few years.
As the accumulation stage progresses, market participants move from being buyers to producers, who increase production to meet the higher demand for commodities. Producers, confident in the growth of the market, invest in new projects and expansion, which further fuels market growth. This increase in supply matches the growth in demand, leading to a bull market.
Active Phase
The active phase is the primary stage of the commodities cycle, marked by a sharp increase in prices. This phase typically occurs when market sentiment turns positive, and more investors and producers join the market. The increase in demand, combined with the decrease in supply, drives up prices. As prices rise, more producers turn to the market to cash in on the high prices, leading to an increase in supply. However, this increase is slower than the increase in demand, resulting in a further surge in prices.
Market participants become highly optimistic as prices continue to rise, fueling a public frenzied price increase. Institutional and individual investors scramble to join the volatility, resulting in excessive speculation. Media and market experts reassure investors of the limitless opportunities, ignoring the possibility of an impending market correction.
Mature Phase
The mature phase comes after an extended increase in commodity prices, resulting in expansive investment and production activities. Market participants climb heights in euphoria, believing that the best is yet to come. During this stage, a dramatic increase in the supply of commodities, mainly driven by new technological developments and lumpy investments, prompts higher selling prices. While the initial bull run subsides, governments scramble to contain buyer worries through deregulation and polish rhetoric.
However, a glance at the fundamentals reveals more extensive reserve levels, ongoing buildup, and variance, ultimately resulting in price corrections. Many experts ponder the impacts of shrinking supply reserves and imply impending prices which is promising for short-term gains.
Bear Market
The final and exhausted phase of the cycle involves steadily declining prices as commodities declare a consolidated profit. Market participants express greater receptiveness to adverse news, consisting mainly of decreased outputs due to over-regulation or supply changes or planned limestone sanctification inefficiencies.

Factors Influencing the Commodities Cycle
The commodities cycle is significantly influenced by several factors including global economic performance, environmental issues, government policies, and demographic trends.
Global Economic Performance
Global economic performance encompasses various indicators such as GDP growth rate, inflation rate, and global industrial production. A growing and industrialized global economy creates a strong demand for commodities, thus leading to upward price trends. Conversely, poor economic performance may also lead to volatility in commodities prices.
Environmental Issues
Natural disasters, droughts, floods, and global environmental challenges, such as climate change, all impact the commodities cycle. Disasters like droughts reduce the supply of certain commodities while increasing demand when current crops become scarce. Similarly, environmental issues increase the costs of production in selected industries leading to higher prices.
Government Policies
