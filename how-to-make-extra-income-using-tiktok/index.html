With its massive user base and a variety of ways to engage with the audience, TikTok has opened doors for individuals and businesses alike to monetize their content and create sustainable income streams.

Partnering with Brands for Sponsored Content</h2><p>Brand sponsorships are one of the most lucrative ways to make extra income on TikTok.
