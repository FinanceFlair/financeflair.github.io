Knowing their features, benefits, and fees helps optimize where you keep your money.</p><h3 id=day-14-identify-consumer-rights-and-protections>Day 14: Identify Consumer Rights and Protections</h3><p>Understand your rights as a borrower and consumer. This knowledge helps you avoid scams, unfair fees, and abusive practices in the financial marketplace.</p><hr><h2 id=week-3-creating-stronger-financial-habits>Week 3: Creating Stronger Financial Habits</h2><h3 id=day-15-automate-your-finances>Day 15: Automate Your Finances</h3><p>Set up automatic bill payments, savings contributions, and investment deposits.

Celebrate each achievement, which reinforces good habits and sustains momentum.</p><h3 id=day-20-practice-mindful-spending>Day 20: Practice Mindful Spending</h3><p>Before making purchases, pause to evaluate if it aligns with your goals and budget. This habit curtails impulsive spending and fosters intentional money management.</p><h3 id=day-21-review-your-progress>Day 21: Review Your Progress</h3><p>Take stock of the past three weeks.
