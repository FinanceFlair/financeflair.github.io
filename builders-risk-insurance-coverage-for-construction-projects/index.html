Builders risk insurance, also known as construction risk insurance or course of construction insurance, is a specialized type of property insurance designed to protect construction projects during the building phase. Unlike traditional property insurance policies that cover completed structures, builders risk insurance provides coverage for buildings and structures while they are under construction, renovation, or repair.</p><h2 id=why-is-builders-risk-insurance-essential-for-construction-projects>Why is Builders Risk Insurance Essential for Construction Projects?</h2><p>Construction sites are vulnerable to a wide range of risks and perils that can result in significant financial losses. Builders risk insurance provides essential protection against these risks, helping contractors and property owners mitigate potential losses and ensure the successful completion of their projects.
