However, planning for the distribution of our assets and possessions is only one part of the equation. A well-crafted estate plan should also take into account your personal values and wishes for the people and organizations you care about.
Understanding the Importance of Values-Based Estate Planning
A values-based estate plan goes beyond the basics of inheritance and asset distribution. It's a thoughtful and intentional approach to ensuring that your legacy continues long after you're gone. This type of planning requires you to think critically about what matters most to you, and how you can use your estate plan to reflect those values.
Identifying Your Personal Values
To create a values-based estate plan, you'll need to take some time to reflect on your personal values and priorities. Consider the following questions:</p><p>What are my core values, and how do I want to be remembered?
What issues are most important to me, and how do I want to support them in my estate plan?
What kind of relationships am I fostering through my charitable giving, and how can I ensure that these relationships continue in the future?
What kind of legacy do I want to leave behind, and how can I use my estate plan to make that happen?</p><p>The Role of Emotions in Estate Planning
When it comes to creating a values-based estate plan, emotions can play a significant role. It's not uncommon for estate planning to involve difficult decisions, such as choosing between family members or organizations to inherit specific assets. However, by focusing on your personal values and priorities, you can make decisions that feel authentic and meaningful to you.
