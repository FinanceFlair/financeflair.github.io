The company has also expanded into premium smartphones, with its Mi Mix series showcasing cutting-edge design and technology. Xiaomi has been particularly aggressive in expanding its market share through online sales channels and expanding its presence in developing regions.</p><p>The company’s aggressive pricing strategy has put pressure on competitors, particularly in the budget and mid-range segments. Furthermore, Xiaomi’s ability to integrate smart home devices, IoT products, and services into its ecosystem has helped it build a loyal customer base and create a connected ecosystem of products.</p><h3 id=oppo-and-vivo>Oppo and Vivo</h3><p>Oppo and Vivo, both owned by the Chinese conglomerate BBK Electronics, are two other major players in the global smartphone market. These brands have gained substantial market share in Asia, particularly in India, Southeast Asia, and China, through a combination of innovative features, aggressive pricing, and effective marketing strategies.</p><p>Oppo is known for its camera technology, particularly in the selfie and mobile photography space. The company has developed several unique innovations, such as the pop-up camera and in-display fingerprint scanner, which have been featured in its flagship devices like the Oppo Find X and Oppo Reno series.</p><p>Vivo, on the other hand, has been a leader in innovation, with its focus on integrating new technologies into its smartphones.
