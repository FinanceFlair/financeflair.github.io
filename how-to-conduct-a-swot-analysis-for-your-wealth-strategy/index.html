What trends or developments can I capitalize on to improve my financial situation?
What changes in the market or economy can I use to my advantage?</p><p>Identifying Threats
Finally, a SWOT analysis involves identifying threats. These are the external factors that can harm your financial well-being. Your threats may include:</p><p>A recession or economic downturn, which can reduce your income and make it harder to save
A market crash or unexpected event, which can wipe out your investment portfolio
A decrease in income or changes in tax laws, which can reduce your ability to save and invest

What trends or developments could potentially undermine my financial plans?
What changes in the market or economy could make it harder for me to achieve my financial objectives?</p><p>Integrating Your Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats
