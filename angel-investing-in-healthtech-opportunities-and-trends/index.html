Team Expertise</h4><p>The success of HealthTech startups often hinges on the expertise of their founding teams. Investors should look for teams with a mix of healthcare knowledge, technical skills, and business acumen. A strong team can navigate challenges and pivot when necessary.</p><h4 id=4-exit-strategy>4.
