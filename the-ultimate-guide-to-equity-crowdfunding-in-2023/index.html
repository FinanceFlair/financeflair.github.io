By investing in a portion of a company's equity, investors become part-owners, entitling them to a share of the company's profits. Equity crowdfunding has made it possible for anyone with internet access to become an investor, regardless of their financial background or net worth.
In 2023, the equity crowdfunding landscape is more vibrant than ever, with a wide range of platforms catering to various investor needs and preferences. From e-commerce and fintech to healthtech and renewable energy, equity crowdfunding has democratized access to funding, empowering entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into successful businesses.
