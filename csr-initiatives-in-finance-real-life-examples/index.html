Over the past few decades, financial institutions have embraced CSR as a way to contribute positively to society, promote ethical practices, and ensure sustainable growth. By incorporating CSR initiatives into their strategies, these companies are not only improving their public image but are also making a substantial impact on communities and the environment.

It encompasses a wide range of actions that demonstrate a commitment to ethical business practices, environmental stewardship, community development, and economic inclusion. These initiatives can take many forms, such as community investments, financial literacy programs, sustainable investment funds, and environmental impact reduction.
