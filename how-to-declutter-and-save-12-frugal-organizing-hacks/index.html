By getting rid of unnecessary items, creating a functional living space, and adopting smart storage solutions, you can say goodbye to wasted money and hello to a clutter-free lifestyle. But, how do you tackle the messy task of decluttering when it feels overwhelming? The key is to start with small, manageable steps and build up your skills and confidence. Here are 12 frugal organizing hacks to help you get started:
#1 Sort, Purge, Donate
Begin by sorting items into categories like clothes, books, kitchen items, and trash. Be ruthless – if you haven't used it in the past year, it's probably safe to get rid of it. Set aside items that are still in good condition but no longer needed and consider donating them to charity. You'll not only be decluttering but also giving back to your community.
How to Purge Like a Pro
When getting rid of items, remove any personal information, take photos of items you want to keep (for future reference), and dispose of items promptly. You can also have a garage sale or sell items online to make some extra cash.
#2 Use the 80/20 Rule
Focus on the items that bring 80% of the value and use while abandoning non-essential items that consume 20%. For example, if your kitchen is cluttered with too many gadgets, prioritize the tools you use daily and discard the rest.
How the 80/20 Rule Works
By embracing the 80/20 rule, you'll maintain a clutter-free space focused on your needs, reducing unnecessary expenses and more efficiently utilizing your limited resources.
#3 Purge Paper Clutter
Stash papers like bills, receipts, and utility statements safely without cluttering your home or damaging the environment. Use digital storage options, scanning documents into files that sync across all your devices.
Keeping Digital Organization in Check
Set reminders for bills due, explore digital platforms like Mint, Digit, or Credit Karma to organize personal finance, and enjoy the peace of mind knowing you're keeping your digital data securely stored.
#4 Get the Right Containers
Labeling containers and maintaining a classified organizer make all the difference in keeping little-used possessions neat and occupying very little space in the home. Keep loose items within containers for tidy shelf space.
Shelves Are Not Trash Containers
Reusable storage bins in your entryways or pantries improve decluttered maintainance without additional clutter building-up accumulation.
#5 Invest in Double Rods
Double Rod organizers double your hanging space providing full-length, double line closet organizers, addressing space scarcity within smaller apartments.
Location Is Everything!
By fitting more garments in your space with double rods, reduce air circulation issues often associated with overstuffed closets.
