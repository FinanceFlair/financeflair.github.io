If you&rsquo;ve ever felt overwhelmed by the idea of investing, you&rsquo;re not alone. Many people are deterred by the traditional investment routes, which often require significant sums of money and a deep understanding of the stock market. Micro investing changes that narrative, allowing anyone to start investing with as little as a few dollars. But with numerous platforms available, each offering unique features, how do you choose the right one for you? Let&rsquo;s dive deep into the world of micro investing to help you make an informed decision.</p><h2 id=what-is-micro-investing>What is Micro Investing?</h2><p>Micro investing is a strategy that involves investing small amounts of money, often through apps or platforms that allow users to gradually build their investment portfolios over time. This approach democratizes investing, making it accessible to a broader audience, especially millennials and Gen Z who may not have substantial funds to invest initially.</p><p>Unlike traditional investing, which might require a minimum investment of hundreds or thousands of dollars, micro investing platforms allow you to invest spare change or small sums regularly.
