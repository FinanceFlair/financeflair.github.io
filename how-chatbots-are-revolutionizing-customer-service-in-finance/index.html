The Rise of Chatbots in Finance
Chatbots have become an integral part of the finance industry, helping customers navigate complex financial products and services. These virtual assistants use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to understand and respond to customer queries, providing quick and relevant solutions to issues such as account balances, loan applications, and investment inquiries.
