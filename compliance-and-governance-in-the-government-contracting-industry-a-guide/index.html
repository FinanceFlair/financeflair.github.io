Providing Training and Awareness</h4><p>Contractors should provide training and awareness programs to educate employees on compliance requirements and the importance of compliance. This includes training on relevant regulations, policies, and procedures.</p><h4 id=3-conducting-regular-audits-and-assessments>3. Conducting Regular Audits and Assessments</h4><p>Contractors should conduct regular audits and assessments to identify compliance risks and ensure that policies and procedures are being followed. This includes internal audits, external audits, and third-party assessments.</p><h4 id=4-maintaining-accurate-records>4. Maintaining Accurate Records</h4><p>Contractors should maintain accurate and complete records of all compliance-related activities, including training, audits, and assessments.
