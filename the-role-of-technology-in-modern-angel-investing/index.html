This shift is transforming the investment landscape, enabling angels to access a broader range of opportunities, make more informed decisions, and achieve better returns.
From Gut-Check Decisions to Data-Driven Investments
Traditionally, angel investors relied on their personal networks, industry expertise, and intuition to identify and invest in promising startups.
