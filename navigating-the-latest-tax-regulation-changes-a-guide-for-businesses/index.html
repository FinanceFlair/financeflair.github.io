With constant updates and amendments to tax laws, it's easy to get caught off guard and risk facing costly penalties or even auditions. However, being informed and proactive about tax changes can help you save time and money, and avoid unnecessary complications.
Understanding the Tax Code
Before diving into the latest tax regulation changes, it's essential to understand the current tax landscape. The tax code, know as the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), is a comprehensive set of laws that governs federal taxation. The IRC is divided into several chapters, each addressing a specific aspect of taxation, such as income tax, employment tax, and excise tax.
One of the most significant aspects of taxation is the concept of tax rates. The tax rates range from 10% to 37%, depending on the taxpayer's income level and filing status. Taxpayers also need to abide by various tax deductions and credits, such as the standard deduction, mortgage interest deduction, and child tax credit.
Recent Tax Regulation Changes
Over the past few years, there have been numerous changes to the tax code, impacting individuals and businesses alike. Some of the key changes include:
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)
The TCJA, signed into law in December 2017, introduced significant changes to the tax code. Some of the core provisions include:</p><p>Corporate Tax Rate Reduction: The corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 21%.
Individual Tax Rate Reduction: The individual tax rate was reduced, with the top rate lowered from 39.6% to 37%.
Deduction Limitations: Deductions for state and local taxes, as well as mortgage interest, were limited.
Child Tax Credit: The child tax credit was doubled to $2,000 and expanded to include more families.</p><p>Revenue Procedure 2019-31
In June 2019, the IRS released Revenue Procedure 2019-31, which provided guidance on the TCJA's net operating loss (NOL) carryover rules. The updates clarified how taxpayers can carry forward and back NOLs, providing clarity on a crucial tax planning strategy.
Treasury Department Regulations
In response to the TCJA, the Treasury Department released a package of regulations and guidance addressing various aspects of the new tax law. Some of the key guidance includes:</p><p>Pass-Through Entity (PTE) Final Regulations: The Treasury Department released final regulations on the taxation of PTEs, which include sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations.
Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII): The Treasury Department provided guidance on the calculation and reporting of FDII, which helps American companies remain competitive in a global economy.</p><p>Navigating the New Tax Landscape
As a business owner, it's essential to stay up-to-date on the latest tax regulation changes. Here are some tips to help you navigate the new tax landscape:
