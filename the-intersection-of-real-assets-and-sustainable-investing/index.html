Real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure, and commodities, have long been a staple of investment portfolios, providing a tangible connection to the physical world and a potential hedge against inflation. However, the intersection of real assets and sustainable investing is a relatively new and rapidly evolving space that holds significant promise for investors seeking to create positive impact.
A Growing Market for Sustainable Investing
The sustainable investing space has grown exponentially over the past decade, with assets in sustainable funds now surpassing $1 trillion. This growth is driven by increasing investor awareness of the relevance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors to risk and return, as well as the long-term consequences of climate change. In response, asset managers, consultants, and wealth managers are developing new products and services that cater to the growing demand for sustainable investments.
Real Assets: A Key Component of Sustainable Investing
Real assets, including real estate, infrastructure, and commodities, play a critical role in sustainable investing. These assets are well-suited to ESG considerations, as they provide a tangible connection to the physical world and are often directly impacted by environmental and social factors. For example, real estate investors can prioritize energy-efficient buildings, reduce carbon emissions, and incorporate green spaces into their designs. Similarly, infrastructure investors can focus on renewable energy projects, green transportation, and sustainable water management.
Impact Investing: A Shared Goal
Impact investing, which seeks to generate both financial returns and positive social or environmental outcomes, is an increasingly common goal among investors. Real assets offer a unique opportunity for impact investing, as they can provide a direct link to the physical world and tangible contributions to sustainability. For instance, investors can prioritize the use of renewable energy sources in real estate development, or invest in infrastructure projects that improve access to clean water or healthcare services.
The Role of ESG in Real Assets
Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations are increasingly important in the real estate and infrastructure sectors. Investors can assess ESG risk through various metrics, including:</p><p>Energy efficiency and carbon emissions
Material suppliers' ESG performance
Employee engagement and retention
Board diversity and independence</p><p>By considering ESG factors in real asset investments, investors can identify opportunities to mitigate risk, improve performance, and contribute to a more sustainable future.
Carbon-Neutralization and Energy Efficiency
Carbon-neutralization and energy efficiency are critical components of sustainable real assets investing. Investors can prioritize investments that have a strong track record of reducing carbon emissions, such as:</p><p>Buildings with LEED or WELL certifications
Renewable energy projects, including solar and wind power
Energy-efficient industrial processes</p><p>By prioritizing carbon-neutralization and energy efficiency, investors can reduce their portfolio's carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.
Sustainable Supply Chains
Sustainable supply chains are essential for real assets investing. Investors can assess supply chain ESG performance by:</p><p>Evaluating the use of sustainable materials and sourcing practices
Assessing supplier labor practices and human rights risks
Evaluating the extent to which supply chain partners prioritize sustainability</p><p>By prioritizing sustainable supply chains, investors can reduce their exposure to ESG risks and contribute to a more sustainable future.
Investing in Sustainable Infrastructure
Sustainable infrastructure investing is a rapidly growing area, with opportunities in:</p><p>Renewable energy projects, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power
Green transportation, including electric vehicles and public transportation
Sustainable water management, including desalination and wastewater treatment</p><p>By investing in sustainable infrastructure, investors can contribute to a more sustainable future and potentially generate long-term financial returns.
The Future of Sustainable Real Assets Investing
The intersection of real assets and sustainable investing is a rapidly evolving space, with significant growth potential and opportunities for investors to create positive impact. As the demand for sustainable investments continues to grow, we can expect to see:</p><p>Increased adoption of ESG metrics and reporting standards
Development of new sustainable products and services
Greater engagement between investors, policymakers, and industry stakeholders</p><p>By prioritizing sustainable real assets investing, investors can contribute to a more sustainable future, generate long-term financial returns, and create positive impact on the environment and society.</p><p>The intersection of real assets and sustainable investing presents a unique opportunity for investors to create positive impact and generate long-term financial returns.
