Companies such as the Goldman Sachs Municipal Bond Fund and the Vanguard Tax-Exempt Bond Index Fund offer a predictable income stream through dividend payouts, driven by the stable interest rates and long-term maturities of municipal bonds.
The Municipal Bonds market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% from 2023 to 2030, driven by the increasing demand for low-risk investments and the growth of state and local government budgets.
