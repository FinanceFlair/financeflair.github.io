As the world grapples with pressing social and environmental challenges, investors and businesses are increasingly recognizing the significance of aligning financial decisions with ethical considerations to foster positive societal impact. This paradigm shift towards ethical investing not only seeks to generate financial returns but also aims to empower communities, promote social equity, and advance environmental sustainability.
Ethical investing, also known as socially responsible investing (SRI) or sustainable investing, encompasses a range of investment strategies that integrate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into the decision-making process. The primary goal of ethical investing is to allocate capital towards companies, projects, and initiatives that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable practices, ethical conduct, and positive societal contribution.
