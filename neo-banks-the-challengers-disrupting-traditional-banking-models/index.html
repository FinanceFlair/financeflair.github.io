These disruptors, known as neo-banks or digital banks, are redefining the way people interact with their money. With their innovative technology and customer-centric approach, neo-banks are challenging the established players and paving the way for a new era in banking.</p><h2 id=what-are-neo-banks>What are Neo-Banks?</h2><p>Neo-banks are fully digital banks that operate exclusively online, without any physical branches. They leverage technology to provide a wide range of banking services, from basic checking and savings accounts to loans and investments.
