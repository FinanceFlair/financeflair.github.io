It involves the process of ensuring that the fund has sufficient liquid assets to meet the redemption requests of its investors. This is particularly important for open-ended mutual funds, which allow investors to buy and sell units at a net asset value (NAV) that is calculated at the end of each trading day.</p><h3 id=the-importance-of-liquidity-management>the importance of liquidity management</h3><p>Liquidity management is crucial because it enables mutual funds to maintain their ability to meet investor redemptions. This is achieved by maintaining a sufficient level of liquid assets, such as cash and short-term securities, that can be quickly converted into cash to meet investor demands.

One of the main benefits is the ability to maintain a stable NAV, which is critical for investor confidence. Another benefit is the ability to minimize the risk of a mutual fund being forced to sell its illiquid securities at a loss, which can have a negative impact on its NAV and the overall returns of its investors.
