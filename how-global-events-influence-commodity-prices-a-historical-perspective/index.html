Commodities, such as oil, gold, silver, natural gas, and foreign exchange rates, are particularly sensitive to global events. A single incident can send shockwaves throughout the world, significantly impacting the prices of these commodities. In this article, we'll delve into the historical perspective of how global events influence commodity prices, shedding light on the factors that contribute to drastic price fluctuations.
1960s: The Suez Crisis and the Advent of Geopolitics in Commodity Markets
The Suez Crisis in 1956 is a prime example of how global events can impact commodity prices. The crisis began when Israel, British, and French forces invaded Egypt, leading to a disruption in oil supplies from the Suez Canal. This blockage caused a significant increase in oil prices, leading to a substantial rise in petroleum products. The events of the Suez Crisis marked a turning point in the world of commodities, introducing geopolitics as a crucial factor in shaping prices.
1970s: The Oil Embargo and the Era of Volatility
The 1970s witnessed the oil embargo imposed by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) in response to the United States' support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War. This devastating embargo led to a dramatic increase in oil prices, marking a new era of volatility in commodity markets. The subsequent oil price shocks led to widespread inflation, recessions, and significant changes in the global economic landscape. The 1970s also saw the birth of the futures market, allowing traders to hedge their bets on commodity prices.
1980s: Deregulation and Free Market Shift
The 1980s ushered in a new era of deregulation and free market ideologies. This shift had a profound impact on commodity markets, as governments began to liberalize trade policies and increase market participation. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, coupled with the shift towards free market capitalism, opened up new trade avenues and gave investors direct access to commodities. This shift marked the beginning of a global market system that relied heavily on supply and demand.
1990s: Globalization and the Rise of Electronic Trading
The 1990s witnessed a seismic shift in the global economy, driven by the advent of globalization. The ease and speed of information transmission led to a significant increase in trade, and the globalization of markets played a pivotal role in price coordination. The evolution of electronic trading platforms further pushed markets into the digital realm, offering unparalleled access to commodity markets for investors from all over the world. Electronic platforms, such as online stock exchanges, automated trading systems, and online brokers, greatly increased liquidity and exchange accessibility.
21st Century: Cyber-Markets and the Zero-Day Markets
In the 21st century, the global event's impact on commodities has accelerated. The emergence of the internet and high capacity personal computers enabled easy access to commodities trading. However, the increased efficiency and speed of electronic transactions have also made markets prone to extreme price fluctuations. New financial instruments, derivates, and the manufacturing of newer exchange currency pairs extended the global capital exchange to areas not seen before.
