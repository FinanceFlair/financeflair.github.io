But before you can start earning, you need to understand how ABS work and how to invest in them.
What are Asset-Backed Securities?
Asset-backed securities are financial instruments that represent a claim on a pool of underlying assets, such as loans, credit card receivables, or lease contracts. These assets are typically backed by collateral, like real estate or inventory, which reduces the risk of default.
Many common types of ABS exist, including:</p><p>Mortgage-backed securities (MBS): These are backed by residential home loans, but they can also include commercial mortgage loans, such as car loans or student loans. They allow lenders to package individual mortgages into securities that can be sold to investors.
Asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP): These products are created by aggregating small receivables, like credit card payments, and issuing short-term securities backed by these assets.
Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs): Similar to ABS, but CLOs represent junior debt in a pool of high-yielding corporate loans.</p><p>How Do ABS Work?
Every ABS transaction involves a diverse set of entities. Here's a breakdown of the key players and their roles:</p><p>Originators: These are the companies that initially issue the underlying loans or create the receivables backing the ABS. They can be banks, credit card companies, or even technology firms.
Sponsors: Sponsors often own the rights to the underlying assets and act as the parties behind the ABS.
Issuers: The issuers create and sell the ABS to investors, which can include funds, banks, or individual investors. Pension funds, in particular, rely heavily on investing in ABS.
Rating Agencies: Rating agencies, like Moody's or Standard & Poor's, assess the creditworthiness of the ABS, evaluating how much cash flow will remain after refinancing and defaults.</p><p>Investing in ABS
ABS can be viewed as a form of participatory ownership in real assets. To invest in these securities, consider the following:</p><p>Start with mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Investing in ABS through funds like Fidelity's Asset-Backed Security or the iShares Mortgage-Backed Bond ETF can help to further diversify your portfolio and can accessibility ease that occurs with investing directly in ABS.
Understand the available interest margins and frequency: Some ABS offer fixed rates, while others are linked to floating interest rates. Research how each type responds during market fluctuations.
Clearly define your buffer versus required margin: It's essential to recognize how discrepancies and fine-tuning can arise.</p><p>Key Considerations
When using ABS for income, consider the following factors to enhance the experience:</p><p>Assign liability levels and dependencies: A well-diversified portfolio is key.
