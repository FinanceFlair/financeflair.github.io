The landscape is ever-shifting, with new rules and regulations being introduced on a frequent basis. It's essential to stay on top of these changes to ensure you're providing the best possible services to your clients while also avoiding any potential pitfalls.
The SEC's New Handbook
One of the most significant recent developments is the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) new handbook on investment advisory and investment company examinations. Released in March 2022, this 250-page document provides detailed guidance on the SEC's expectations for investment advisors and their regulatory compliance obligations. It's a comprehensive resource that covers everything from advertising and marketing to custody procedures and more.
For financial advisors, this handbook offers valuable insights into the SEC's priorities and areas of focus. By understanding what the SEC is looking for, you can refine your internal controls, revisit your compliance procedures, and ensure you're meeting the necessary standards. Some key areas to focus on include:</p><p>Ensuring accurate and timely reporting of Form ADV Form amendments and updates
Verifying the accuracy and completeness of fund manager due diligence reports
Conducting thorough risk assessments and providing detailed explanations of risk management strategies
Maintaining complete and up-to-date records of all investment activities
Illuminating and discussing client communications, proximity trading, and conflicts of interest</p><p>The Benefits of Compliance
Regulatory compliance is often viewed as a necessary evil, but it's essential to recognize the benefits it offers. By meeting the SEC's requirements, you can:</p><p>Protect your clients and your firm from costly fines and reputational damage
Enhance your firm's credibility and standing with clients and industry peers
Ensure seamless regulatory exams and fewer audits
Streamline operations and reduce administrative burdens
Protect yourself and your firm from potential lawsuits</p><p>New Rules for Private Fund Managers
In August 2021, the SEC introduced new Rule 222-5, which applies to private fund managers, requiring them to establish and maintain ongoing operational compliance programs that encompass governance, policies, procedures, and risk management. The rule applies to fund managers who are investments advisers or are holding themselves out as investment advisers with respect to private fund investments.
For private fund managers, this introduces new regulatory requirements, including the necessity to:</p><p>Establish an operations manual
Document ongoing compliance procedures and processes
Conduct regular audits and risk assessments
Develop comprehensive investor-facing policies
Monitor registered representatives and applicable regulations</p><p>ERISA Fiduciaries and Their Responsibilities
