One of the most effective tools for achieving this goal is the generation-skipping trust.
What is a Generation-Skipping Trust?
A generation-skipping trust (GST) is a type of trust designed to allow you to transfer wealth to your grandchildren without being subject to estate and gift taxes. Traditional trusts, on the other hand, are subject to the maximum estate tax exemption amount, which limits the amount of assets that can be transferred to the next generation without incurring significant tax liabilities.
Key Characteristics of a Generation-Skipping Trust</p><p>Irrebuttable presumption: A GST is created with a life tenancy, meaning that the trust will be irrevocable for the lifetime of the beneficiaries, who will have an unshakable right to receive the trust's principal if they survive the life tenancy.
Lapse bypass: If the named beneficiaries die before the life tenancy, the assets can bypass their estates and be distributed directly to their lineal descendants, skipping over their estates.
Tax savings: GSTs enable you to transfer wealth to your grandchildren in smaller increments without being subject to the estate tax. This can save thousands of dollars in taxes over time.</p><p>How to Establish a Generation-Skipping Trust</p><p>Postsale transaction: To create a GST, you need to establish a trust and transfer assets to it during your lifetime.
