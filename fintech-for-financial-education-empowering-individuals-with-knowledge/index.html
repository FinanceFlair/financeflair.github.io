Fintech, short for financial technology, has emerged as a powerful tool in democratizing access to financial education, empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources needed to navigate the complexities of modern finance. From budgeting and investing to managing debt and planning for retirement, fintech platforms are revolutionizing the way people learn about and interact with their finances.
