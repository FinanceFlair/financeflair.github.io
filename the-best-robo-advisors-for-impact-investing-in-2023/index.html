Instead of just focusing on financial returns, impact investors aim to generate positive social and environmental change alongside financial gain. One of the best ways to engage in impact investing is through robo-advisors, which provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services. These platforms have grown in popularity due to their ease of use, low fees, and accessibility. But not all robo-advisors are created equal, especially when it comes to impact investing.</p><p>In this blog post, we will explore the best robo-advisors for impact investing in 2023. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned investor or new to the world of socially responsible investing (SRI), these platforms can help you invest with a purpose. Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p><h2 id=what-is-impact-investing>What Is Impact Investing?</h2><p>Impact investing refers to investments made with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact, alongside a financial return. This investment strategy focuses on creating change in areas such as climate change, renewable energy, affordable housing, gender equality, and more. Unlike traditional investments that prioritize only financial returns, impact investing strives to make a difference in the world while also achieving a reasonable return on investment.</p><p>Impact investing has gained momentum in recent years, driven by growing awareness of social and environmental issues. Investors are no longer satisfied with merely avoiding harm through traditional investments; they want to actively promote change.

The robo-advisor then creates a portfolio that reflects these preferences while managing risk and maximizing returns.</p><p>While many robo-advisors offer a broad range of portfolios, only some specialize in impact investing. These platforms are crucial for those who want to take a hands-off approach to their impact investments while ensuring their money supports causes that matter to them.</p><h2 id=the-best-robo-advisors-for-impact-investing-in-2023>The Best Robo-Advisors for Impact Investing in 2023</h2><h3 id=1-betterment>1. <strong>Betterment</strong></h3><p>Betterment is one of the most well-known robo-advisors, and it has made strides in the impact investing space.
