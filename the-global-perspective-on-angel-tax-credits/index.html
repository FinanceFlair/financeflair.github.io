What are Angel Tax Credits?
Angel tax credits, also known as angel investor tax credits, are a type of tax incentive designed to encourage angel investors to invest in start-ups and small businesses.

The United Kingdom: The UK's Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) offer tax reliefs to angel investors, including income tax and capital gains tax relief.
