This blog post delves into the key consumer behavior trends we can expect in developed markets in 2024, providing insights that can help brands tailor their strategies effectively.</p><h2 id=1-the-rise-of-conscious-consumerism>1. The Rise of Conscious Consumerism</h2><p>The concept of conscious consumerism is gaining significant traction among consumers in developed markets. More individuals are prioritizing ethical considerations in their purchasing decisions.

Economic Sensitivity and Value Consciousness</h2><p>As we navigate an uncertain economic landscape, consumers in developed markets are becoming more value-conscious.
