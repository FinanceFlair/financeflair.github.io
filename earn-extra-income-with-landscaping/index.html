One of the most rewarding and flexible ways to earn extra income is through landscaping. Landscaping not only provides a sense of accomplishment from transforming outdoor spaces, but it also offers the potential for a steady income stream, whether you choose to pursue it as a part-time hobby or a full-fledged business.
Starting a landscaping side hustle doesn&rsquo;t require a huge initial investment. Many people begin with basic tools and gradually build their equipment as they gain experience and clients.
