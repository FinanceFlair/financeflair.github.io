It provides a roadmap for individuals to achieve their financial objectives by setting clear goals, managing risks, and optimizing resources. In the realm of investing, having a well-defined financial plan is essential for making informed decisions, staying disciplined, and ultimately realizing long-term success.

Setting clear and specific financial goals is the foundation of any effective financial plan.
