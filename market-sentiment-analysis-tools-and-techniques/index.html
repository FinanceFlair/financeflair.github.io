This sophisticated tool has been getting increasingly sophisticated, thanks to advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) technologies. In this article, we'll delve into the world of market sentiment analysis, exploring the tools and techniques that power this all-important field.
What is Market Sentiment Analysis?
Market sentiment analysis involves analyzing and interpreting the emotions and attitudes expressed by market participants, such as investors, analysts, and traders.
