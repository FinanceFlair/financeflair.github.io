With the global population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, the demand for seafood has never been higher. To meet this demand while ensuring the long-term sustainability of our oceans, it's essential to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate the trends that will shape the future of fishing commodities.
Sustainable Fishing Practices on the Rise
One of the most significant trends in the fishing industry is the increasing focus on sustainable fishing practices. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental impact of their food choices, and seafood companies are responding by adopting more eco-friendly methods. This includes the use of eco-labels such as MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) and ASC (Aquaculture Stewardship Council) to assure customers that their seafood is caught or farmed in a responsible manner.
Example: Scottish seafood
The Scottish seafood industry is a prime example of this trend. Scottish fishermen are now using selective gear, such as trawl nets with escape panels, to reduce bycatch and protect endangered species. Additionally, they're working with academia and industry partners to develop new fishing gear that reduces waste and minimizes bycatch.
Aquaculture: A Growing Sector
Aquaculture, the farming of fish and other seafood, is projected to become a significant player in the global seafood market. In 2019, aquaculture accounted for over 20% of global seafood production, with many countries investing heavily in this sector. The move towards aquaculture is mainly driven by concerns over overfishing, habitat degradation, and climate change.
Controversies around aquaculture
However, not all aquaculture is created equal. The environmental and social impacts of large-scale aquaculture operations, such as escaped farmed fish and marine debris, have raised concerns among environmentalists. These concerns are likely to be a focus in the coming years.
Shifts in Consumer Behavior
The way consumers think about fish is changing. Gone are the days of simple, affordable fish and chips. Today's consumers prioritize flavor, freshness, and sustainability, driving demand for high-quality seafood. Omnics, or owned-and-operated restaurants, are rising in popularity, giving consumers direct access to fresh and sustainable seafood.
Love for exotic species
The international fish market has expanded to the adventurous consumer, who seeks wild and sustainable seafood options. Restaurants are responding by incorporating exotic species, such as blue marlin and Japanese mullet, into their offerings. Furthermore, social media platforms are driving demand for high-quality seafood by showcasing visually appealing dishes and organic content.
Incorporating Food Technology to Increase Efficiency and Sustainability
Digitalization and food tech, like integrated data analytics and precision farming, are transforming the way seafood is farmed and traded. Robotics, smart cages, and underwater monitoring technology are helping to reduce costs, improve yields, and optimize properties, all of which points to a more sustainable seafood industry.

Looking Ahead to 2024
The future of fishing commodities will be determined by our collective ability to adapt and innovate in the face of climate change, rising demand, and evolving consumer preferences. The trends and insights outlined in this post provide a glimpse into the transformation already underway in the seafood industry. As the industry continues to evolve, we must prioritize sustainable fishing practices, new technologies, and innovative production systems that serve both people and the planet.
