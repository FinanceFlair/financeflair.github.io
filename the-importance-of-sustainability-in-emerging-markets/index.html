However, as these economies continue to rise, they are facing a critical challenge: the need for sustainable development. As millions of people are lifted out of poverty, the strains on resources, infrastructure, and environmental ecosystems are growing exponentially. It's a ticking time bomb, but one that can be defused with a concerted effort towards sustainability.
The Unsustainable State of Affairs
In the haste to industrialize and modernize, emerging markets have largely ignored the environmental and social impact of their growth. The consequences are stark: air and water pollution, deforestation, and plummeting biodiversity. The World Bank estimates that, in the next decade alone, the environmental damage caused by human activities in emerging markets could wipe out 1% of global GDP. It's a stark reminder that the laws of economics and sustainability are inextricably linked.
The Hidden Costs of Unsustainability
Sir Angus Deaton, a Nobel laureate in economics, has highlighted the paradox of economics in emerging markets: "&mldr;more income makes people healthier, happier, and more likely to live longer&mldr;but also more inclined to burn fossil fuels, induce deforestation, and desecrate ecosystems." The financial costs are not just environmental, but also social and economic. In the absence of sustainable development, emigrants to older economies can expect reduced crop yields, diminished economic growth, and reduced resource availability, further entrenching existing inequalities.
Harnessing the Power of Sustainable Development
So, what can be done? Historical examples abound, from fossil-fuel companies transitioning to greener futures, to economic migrants leveraging sustainable consumption choices. Business is playing a vital role, from low-carbon investment to sustinable supply chains, to positively impact market success.
