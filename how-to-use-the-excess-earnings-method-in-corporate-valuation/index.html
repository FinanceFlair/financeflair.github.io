One approach standing the test of time, often surfacing in divorce, partnership disputes, and certain IRS matters, is the <strong>Excess Earnings Method</strong>. Though sometimes viewed as old-fashioned, this method delivers deep insight, particularly for closely held companies with complex asset bases or for cases where intangible value matters as much as the tangible.</p><p>This comprehensive guide walks you through the origins, the mechanics, and nuanced steps of applying the Excess Earnings Method, and how it stacks up in the modern valuation landscape.</p><hr><h2 id=what-is-the-excess-earnings-method>What is the Excess Earnings Method?</h2><p>The Excess Earnings Method is a hybrid valuation technique that interfaces between asset-based and income-based approaches. First introduced by the U.S. Treasury Department in the 1920s—specifically in IRS Revenue Ruling 68-609—it was initially a guideline for valuing <strong>goodwill</strong> in situations where conventional market approaches struggled, especially for businesses with significant intangible assets.</p><p>The underlying theory is simple: a business should generate a fair return on its tangible assets. Anything above that benchmark—“excess earnings”—is attributable to intangible assets like proprietary processes, brand recognition, customer relationships, and, importantly, goodwill. By isolating these “excess” profits, appraisers can estimate the value of intangible assets and, ultimately, the overall business.</p><hr><h2 id=when-to-use-the-excess-earnings-method>When to Use the Excess Earnings Method</h2><p>Not all companies or scenarios are right for this approach. The method is most useful under certain conditions:</p><ul><li>The business is closely held, and public market data is not readily available.</li><li>The company owns a combination of tangible and significant intangible assets.</li><li>There is a need to value goodwill, such as in divorce litigations, partnership splits, estate, or gift taxation.</li><li>Other valuation methods yield widely divergent results, especially in asset-heavy businesses.</li></ul><p>Sectors such as engineering firms, law practices, auto dealerships, and small manufacturing often fit these criteria.</p><hr><h2 id=step-by-step-application-of-the-excess-earnings-method>Step-by-Step Application of the Excess Earnings Method</h2><p>Let’s explore the practical steps required to implement this method.</p><h3 id=1-normalize-historical-earnings>1. Normalize Historical Earnings</h3><p>Start by collecting the company’s financial statements, typically for the last five years. Normalize earnings by adjusting for:</p><ul><li>Owner’s compensation and perks above-market rates</li><li>One-time or non-recurring expenses or revenues</li><li>Non-operational revenues/expenses</li><li>Any other extraordinary items skewing the true operating performance</li></ul><p>The goal is to produce a baseline ‘benefit stream’—usually <strong>normalized EBITDA</strong> or <strong>net income</strong>—that reflects the company’s true ongoing earnings power.</p><h3 id=2-establish-the-value-of-net-tangible-assets>2. Establish the Value of Net Tangible Assets</h3><p>Calculate the <strong>fair market value</strong> of the business’s tangible assets—</p><ul><li>Real estate</li><li>Machinery and equipment</li><li>Inventory</li><li>Receivables (less bad debt reserves)</li><li>Prepaid expenses</li><li>Minus: all tangible liabilities (debts, accounts payable, etc.)</li></ul><p>This yields the <strong>net tangible asset value</strong> (NTAV)—the portion of enterprise value anchored by hard assets.</p><h3 id=3-determine-a-fair-return-on-tangible-assets>3. Determine a Fair Return on Tangible Assets</h3><p>A crucial and sometimes debated step: assign a reasonable rate of return on the net tangible asset base. The rate should reflect returns common for similar investments, factoring in risk, inflation, and prevailing interest rates.</p><p>For instance, an appraiser might select a rate of return based on:</p><ul><li>The average interest rate on long-term corporate bonds</li><li>The average return on equity investments in the relevant sector</li><li>A composite of various economic indicators</li></ul><p>Multiply the NTAV by the selected fair return rate. This amount is the <strong>expected earnings</strong> on tangible assets.</p><h3 id=4-calculate-excess-earnings>4. Calculate Excess Earnings</h3><p>Subtract the expected earnings on tangible assets (from Step 3) from the normalized earnings (from Step 1):</p><p><code>Excess Earnings = Normalized Earnings – Required Return on NTAV</code></p><p>What remains—the ‘excess earnings’—is ascribed to the company’s intangible assets.</p><h3 id=5-capitalize-excess-earnings>5. Capitalize Excess Earnings</h3><p>Decide on an appropriate capitalization rate for intangible assets. This rate should reflect the risks associated with intangibles, which are often higher than those for tangible assets. Factors influencing the rate include:</p><ul><li>Industry volatility</li><li>Depth of management</li><li>Market position</li><li>Customer concentration</li><li>Remaining useful economic life of intangible assets</li></ul><p>Commonly, the cap rate for intangibles may range from 15% to as high as 30% or even greater, depending on the specific risk profile.</p><p>Divide the excess earnings by this capitalization rate:</p><p><code>Value of Intangibles = Excess Earnings / Capitalization Rate</code></p><p>This yields the <strong>value attributable to intangible assets</strong>.</p><h3 id=6-calculate-total-business-value>6. Calculate Total Business Value</h3><p>Finally, add the value of intangible assets to the net tangible asset value derived earlier:</p><p><code>Total Business Value = NTAV + Value of Intangibles</code></p><p>When valuing only the equity (as opposed to total business/enterprise value), subtract interest-bearing liabilities.</p><hr><h2 id=example-walking-through-the-calculation>Example: Walking Through the Calculation</h2><p>Suppose <strong>Precision Gearworks</strong>, a niche manufacturer, has normalized net income of $900,000 per year, NTAV of $3,500,000, and appraisers choose an 8% fair return on tangible assets, and a 20% capitalization rate for excess earnings.</p><p><strong>Step-by-Step Calculations:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Normalized Earnings:</strong> $900,000</li><li><strong>Return on NTAV:</strong> $3,500,000 x 8% = $280,000</li><li><strong>Excess Earnings:</strong> $900,000 – $280,000 = $620,000</li><li><strong>Capitalize Excess Earnings:</strong> $620,000 / 20% = $3,100,000</li><li><strong>Total Business Value:</strong> $3,500,000 (NTAV) + $3,100,000 (Intangibles) = $6,600,000</li></ol><p>If Precision Gearworks carries $500,000 in debt, the equity value would be $6,100,000.</p><hr><h2 id=key-considerations-and-pitfalls>Key Considerations and Pitfalls</h2><p>While the methodology is straightforward, the art lies in the judgment calls.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Selecting Rates:</strong> Small differences in the fair return or capitalization rate can cause significant swings in value. Surveying industry benchmarks, comparable deals, and current risk-free rates helps anchor these assumptions, but ultimately, the rate selection should be tailored to the company’s facts and circumstances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Asset Valuation:</strong> Relying on carried book values can understate or overstate NTAV. Engaging specialists for machinery, real estate, and inventory appraisals may be warranted, especially if the business has not had recent third-party valuations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Earnings Normalization:</strong> Overlooked add-backs or non-operating items can render the analysis moot. Scrutinizing line items and footnotes, and having conversations with management, helps ensure thorough normalization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Intangible Life:</strong> Some argue that using a straight cap rate for intangibles assumes perpetual economic life, which isn’t always realistic. As a refinement, some appraisers discount excess earnings over a finite period (reflecting technology, customer, or market obsolescence).</p></li><li><p><strong>Not for Everything:</strong> Asset-light, highly scalable businesses or start-ups—especially those with negative or unpredictable earnings—are usually better valued via discounted cash flow or guideline market methods.</p></li></ul><hr><h2 id=advantages-and-drawbacks>Advantages and Drawbacks</h2><p>Why might you lean into the Excess Earnings Method, despite other available approaches?</p><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Blends Tangibles and Intangibles:</strong> Unlike pure DCF or asset-based methods, it directly values both hard and soft assets.</li><li><strong>Useful for Private Companies:</strong> Especially where market comparables are scarce.</li><li><strong>IRS Endorsement:</strong> Often accepted in legal, tax, and marital contexts.</li></ul><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Subjectivity:</strong> Heavy reliance on judgment for rates and adjustments.</li><li><strong>Data Intensive:</strong> Requires accurate, up-to-date appraisals of all assets and careful financial normalization.</li><li><strong>Dated Origin:</strong> Seen by some as less suitable for rapid-growth firms, SaaS, or start-ups.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=practical-scenarios-and-modern-adjustments>Practical Scenarios and Modern Adjustments</h2><p>While some see the method as “old-school,” it remains a preferred approach for certain assignments.</p><ul><li><strong>Divorce and Litigation:</strong> Courts frequently reference this method when dividing businesses or estimating personal goodwill versus enterprise goodwill.</li><li><strong>Gifting and Estate Planning:</strong> The IRS historically accepts the method in estate and gift tax cases.</li><li><strong>Integrated with Other Approaches:</strong> Many modern appraisals use the Excess Earnings Method to cross-validate results, especially if market data are inconsistent or limited.</li></ul><p>Nuanced modifications—like using a multi-period excess earnings model (MPEEM) for specific intangibles, or adopting market-based cap rates—allow for greater precision in contemporary settings.</p><hr><h2 id=how-it-compares-to-other-valuation-methods>How It Compares to Other Valuation Methods</h2><p><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):</strong> Focuses on future cash flows, discounted to present value. Best for forecasting heavy growth or volatile earnings, but less useful when future projections are too speculative.</p><p><strong>Market Multiples:</strong> Values the business based on trading or transaction multiples of comparable companies. Needs robust market data—which can be scarce for niche or private companies.</p><p><strong>Asset-based:</strong> Totals up the value of assets minus liabilities. Straightforward, but ignores intangibles unless excess earnings are considered.</p><p><strong>Excess Earnings Method:</strong> Bridges the gap—capturing both asset and earning power while drawing a sometimes-needed line between tangible and intangible value.</p><hr><h2 id=best-practices-and-final-thoughts>Best Practices and Final Thoughts</h2><p>Success with the Excess Earnings Method hinges on careful data gathering, prudent normalization, thoughtful rate selection, and transparent calculations. When used in tandem with other approaches and under the right circumstances, it provides a nuanced understanding—especially of the value buried in intangible assets.</p><p>Valuing a company is as much science as art. The Excess Earnings Method continues to earn its place among the toolkit of seasoned business appraisers, offering a granular picture that’s unmatched when tangible and intangible value intersect.</p><p>Approach each assignment with sound judgment, documentation, and a readiness to justify your assumptions, and this venerable method can bring new clarity to some of the valuation world’s most nuanced challenges.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://finance.googlexy.com/categories/corporate-valuation-methods/>Corporate Valuation Methods</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://finance.googlexy.com/how-to-use-the-excess-earnings-method-for-corporate-valuation/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Use the Excess Earnings Method for Corporate Valuation</span>
