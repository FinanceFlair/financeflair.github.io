Ethical investment funds, often dubbed socially responsible investment (SRI) funds or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) funds, have moved from niche offerings to mainstream financial vehicles attracting significant capital flows globally. This surge is propelled by growing awareness of climate change, social justice issues, corporate governance scandals, and the broader desire for investments that contribute positively to society and the environment.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to channel your capital into funds that not only generate financial returns but also foster positive change, this comprehensive guide to leading ethical investment funds offers valuable insights.
