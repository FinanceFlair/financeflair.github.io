Gone are the days when online and offline shopping were viewed as separate entities. Today, retailers are focusing on integrating these channels to provide consumers with a unified experience.</p><h3 id=the-importance-of-integration>The Importance of Integration</h3><p>Retailers are leveraging technology to create a cohesive shopping journey.
