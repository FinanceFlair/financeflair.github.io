Countries such as China, India, and Brazil offer a wealth of opportunities, from rapidly growing economies to developing infrastructure and services markets. However, there is a catch: currency risks in emerging markets can be significant, and investors need to be aware of the implications.</p><p>Currency volatility</p><p>Currency valuation is a critical component of emerging market investing. A depreciation in the local currency can wipe out returns from asset price appreciation, thereby eroding the investments' real value. This adds a layer of complexity to portfolio management, as investors need to consider not only asset-specific risks but also currency-specific risks.</p><p>Central bank intervention</p><p>Central banks in emerging markets often intervene to manage currency fluctuations. They can increase foreign exchange reserves by selling domestic currency, reduce the money supply, or implement capital controls. These interventions can lead to inconsistencies in the exchange rate data and make it challenging for investors to gage effective currency risk.</p><p>Currency protection mechanisms</p><p>Investors can use various currency protection mechanisms to mitigate currency risk. For example, investors can opt for dividends to be paid in local currency rather than foreign currency, incurring exchange rate risk. This allows the investor to keep the parental discipline and not be beholden to an underwritten global pound arrangement.
