Strategies to Follow</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Diversification</strong>: Diversifying your investment portfolio helps mitigate risk during deflation. A balanced approach to equities and fixed income securities can be effective.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investing Long-Term</strong>: Embrace a long-term investment strategy where your dollars accumulate over time. In most cases, working against an inflation rate, long-term investments tend to perform well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Speculative Assets</strong>: Stay clear of investments with high volatility and avoid putting too much capital into speculative areas like cryptocurrencies. Stick to known instruments with a proven track record.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3. Understanding when Deflation&rsquo;s End is Nigh</strong></p><p>Watches, wallets, barbers, and even insurance companies offer insights into the economy&rsquo;s health, indicating the start and potential end of deflation.
