Choose the Right Tracking Method</h3><p>There are several ways to track your investments, ranging from manual methods to using sophisticated tools. Some popular options include:</p><ul><li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong>: For those who prefer a hands-on approach, creating a spreadsheet can be a great way to track your investments.

Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</h3><p>CAGR measures the annual growth rate of an investment over a specific period. It’s a useful metric for comparing the performance of different assets. The formula is:</p><p>[
CAGR = \left( \frac{Ending Value}{Beginning Value} \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
]</p><p>Where <em>n</em> is the number of years.</p><h3 id=3-asset-allocation>3. Asset Allocation</h3><p>Evaluate your asset allocation to ensure you’re diversifying your investments appropriately.
