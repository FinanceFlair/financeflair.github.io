Since 2008, the regulatory overhaul in financial regulations has resulted in stricter rules and guidelines for financial institutions, impacting not just large corporations but also small businesses. The vulnerabilities of the financial system and the subsequent crisis led to calls for greater oversight and increased capital requirements for banks. As the regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, small businesses can expect additional costs and compliance burdens. In this post, we will examine how these changes are affecting small businesses.
Changes in Account Regulations
Part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was aimed at overhauling the way financial institutions operate and conduct their business. The overhaul included changes to the regulation of FDIC-insured accounts. The Act is comprehensive and aimed at increasing financial transparency and stability. Previously, banks were not required to ensure the funds in interest-bearing accounts exceeded the insured amount for protection against bank failure. However, the new regulations changed this. Today, banks are required to restrict the use of wholesale, short-term funding from non-bank sources, ceilings of 10% on shares issued by banks, and restrictions on accessing their money markets from excess liquidity. The two-tiered system affects all banks regardless of their size, putting a strain on a small business's expense account when it becomes complex.
Increased Costs for Compliance
One of the major implications of the new financial regulations for small businesses is the increased expense concerning compliance. According to a study, 61% of small business owners said it was harder to persuade banks to lend money to them. Having confidence in the tenure of their institutions has major benefits. As evidence shows that running cash-drained is way harder on local firm considering this net finance decision. A myriad of paperwork, computer software and yearly assessments to ensure production data day compliance has created an environment that would have reasonably operated with less complexity just a few years ago.
