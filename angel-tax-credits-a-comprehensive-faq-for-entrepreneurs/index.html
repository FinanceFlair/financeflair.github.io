However, with the emergence of angel tax credits, startups are now receiving funding opportunities that can help bridge the gap between idea and reality. But, do you know what angel tax credits are, how they work, and which states offer them?
What are Angel Tax Credits?
Angel tax credits, also known as Qualified Small Business Enterprise (QSBE) tax credits, are state-level incentives designed to stimulate the growth of small businesses by providing tax credits to investors who invest in startups. The primary goal is to promote innovation, job creation, and economic development by encouraging angel investors to invest in high-growth, high-potential companies.
History of Angel Tax Credits
The history of angel tax credits dates back to 1993 when the State of Illinois introduced its first version of the program. Since then, numerous states have adopted their own versions of the angel tax credit program, with New York, New Jersey, and Michigan being among the pioneers of this initiative. Currently, over a dozen states are offering angel tax credits to encourage business growth and job creation.
How Do Angel Tax Credits Work?
Angel tax credits work on a simple principle: when an investor invests in a QSBE, the state offers a tax credit to the investor for a portion of their investment. This credit can be used to reduce the investor's state income tax liability or sold to a third party for cash.

Securing angel tax credits can tip the scale in favor of competing startups, providing them with a competitive edge in the market.</li><li>Increased Liquidity
Angel tax credits can reduce the pressure on entrepreneurs to rely solely on debt financing, allowing them to maintain ownership and decision-making authority.
