Crowdfunding platforms have redefined the landscape of creative funding, offering artists and designers a direct channel to connect with a global audience and secure support for their projects. The democratization of funding through platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and Patreon has dismantled traditional barriers, empowering creators from diverse backgrounds to access financial backing and validation for their artistic endeavors.
