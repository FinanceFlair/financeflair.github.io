By minimizing trading activity and focusing on long-term growth, passive investing seeks to capture market returns while keeping fees and taxes low.</p><h4 id=insights>Insights:</h4><ul><li><strong>Cost-Efficiency:</strong> Passive investing typically incurs lower fees compared to actively managed strategies, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors.</li><li><strong>Diversification:</strong> By investing in a broad range of assets, passive strategies help mitigate single-stock risk and provide exposure to various sectors and industries.</li><li><strong>Long-Term Focus:</strong> Passive investing is well-suited for investors with a long-term investment horizon, as it aims to capitalize on the overall growth of the market over time.</li></ul><h3 id=2-tax-loss-harvesting>2.
