Contrarian investors thrive in a world where everyone believes the market is going up, but making a killing when they realize their mistake. Understanding market psychology is crucial to making contrarian investment decisions.
Reading the right books can help you cultivate the skills necessary to be a successful contrarian investor. Here are the best books on contrarian investing that you cannot ignore.</p><ol><li>"A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by Burton G. Malkiel
While Malkiel emphasizes the power of both fundamental analysis and technical analysis in his book, "A Random Walk Down Wall Street," the take-home message is unmistakable. The essence of contrarian investing lies in its ability to go against the majority opinion, not in being a bit player in the wave of excitement surrounding a particular investment. Malkiel sets the foundation for contrarian investing by revealing how investors waste millions chasing investment opportunities that the general public is enamored about, even when data suggests otherwise. One can't miss the points made regarding the futility of trying to outperform the market through fancy formulas.</li><li>"Security Analysis" by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd
Benjamin Graham, often referred to as the father of value investing, co-authored the "Security Analysis" book with David Dodd in 1934. Graham laid the foundation of traditional value investing by outlining specific investment criteria that relativized share prices. Value investing's stabilizing principle can be translated into considering skepticism about popular opinions about investments and rejecting the complex models most analysts favor when spending hours analyzing stocks. The book is &ndash; and continues to be &ndash; a guide to investors seeking a different route in the market.</li><li>"The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham
"The Intelligent Investor" is Benjamin Graham's most famous work, featuring notable topics in the fundamentals of value investing as well as stock analysis. What really stands out from the book is its emphasis on evidence-based decision-making over emotional choices that skew analysis. You might disagree or find it altogether unbelievable, but your actions should be grounded in the data nonetheless. Graham anchors this concept into conservative and successful stockholders always in play.</li><li>"Security Analysis: Revised Edition" by Benjamin Graham
As opposed to the traditional "Security Analysis," this revised version stays up-to-date with modern banking practices while preceding specific trusted advice rather than scientific methodology. Dividend-based knowledge aids not just those looking for total income as an investment vehicle, but also low assumptive stock ideas not hesitating from market instability. Even if you're calamitous on the verge of redemption in the midst of rising stock market swings, you'll develop a sense of how Graham characterizes needs, flaws, and peaks by virtue of experience.</li><li>"The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America" by Lawrence Cunningham
