These investors often fill the gap left by venture capitalists, especially in the early stages of company formation when traditional funding sources are scarce.</p><h3 id=characteristics-of-angel-investors>Characteristics of Angel Investors</h3><p>Angel investors typically have a considerable amount of disposable income and a desire to support emerging businesses. They are often entrepreneurs themselves, bringing not just capital but also mentorship, industry connections, and business acumen to the table. This involvement can significantly enhance the chances of a startup&rsquo;s success.</p><h2 id=the-intersection-of-real-estate-and-angel-investing>The Intersection of Real Estate and Angel Investing</h2><p>While angel investing is commonly associated with tech startups and innovative businesses, real estate offers a compelling opportunity for angel investors.
